# README

Basic tool for dumping all gitlab repos using the API.  
You will need a gitlab access-token with "API" privileges.  
You'll also need "rar" and "python" in your path if you use the `dump_gitlab.bat` file.  

Install python dependencies based on `requirements.txt` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
